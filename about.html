      <about>I am 16 years old and a senior at Cherry Hill High School East in Cherry Hill, NJ. At my school, I am apart of an all-girls robotics team and participate in other STEM-related clubs as well. I also love helping others, so I volunteer at the local library! I love to hang out with my friends and binge watch on Netflix in my free time. After participating in the Girls Who Code SIP at AIG, I now know that I want to major in Computer Science.

      <about>I’m a high school junior from Toms River, New Jersey I love my dog Karma and playing lacrosse! My favorite things to do are going to the beach with friends or going for a run. I’m constantly making people laugh which is the best feeling. I participated in the 2018 Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program and I wish to attend college somewhere in New York City!

      <about>I’m 17 years old and am going into my junior year at Central Bucks West High School in PA. I’m involved in several STEM and women's empowerment clubs at my high school. Next year, I hope to start a Girls Who Code club at West! I love hanging out with my dogs and going to the gym. Out of college, I hope to do something in law enforcement(sorry mom)!
