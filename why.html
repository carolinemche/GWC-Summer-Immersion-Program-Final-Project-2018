      <info>We wanted to be able to offer a chance for girls to reach out to women. It is important to network and make connections with other women in such a male dominated field. So many girls need to know that there are technology programs and organizations that they can be apart of. We realized that there was no platform like this existing. We thought that needed to change so we ended up with GetTech'd
