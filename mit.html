      <info>The MIT Women's Technology is a summer program offered to 11th grade girls. It is a rigorous four-week summer academic and residential experience program. Participants have the chance to explore different categories of technology. They have the option of choosing Electrical Engineering and Computer Science or Mechanical Engineering. The program is very selective as they look for girls who excel at math and science at school and have very little knowledge in engineering or computer science. The program covers most costs and they also offer fee waivers and scholarships for eligible participants.
