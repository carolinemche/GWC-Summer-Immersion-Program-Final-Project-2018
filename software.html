Through my studies I explore political and societal topics by creating art work that challenges oppression. I focus on telling stories through digital art and technology. Growing up I've always wanted to make a difference in the world. What I've learned over years is that you must first start with yourself. With that in mind, I plan to start my own production company that gives a voice to the unheard through multi-media. In addition to my production company I plan to start a non-profit organization, a community based art and technology center that equips low-income and minority families with tools, opportunities and resources to challenge the lack of Black and Latinx people in technology. I hope to change the world one laugh, tear, and step at a time. :)"

        <about>"I’m Adrienne. I'm Filipina, married, no kids, and currently enjoying life and achieving life goals as a Software Engineer in Las Vegas.
        </br>
        As far as my background, I’m originally from California although I’ve lived in other states and even the Philippines for a few years. I went to UNLV (Go Rebels!) and graduated a semester early with a degree in Management Information Systems while also working full-time. Since then, I've worked at several jobs all over Las Vegas, in various industries like Higher Education, Healthcare, and Consumer Services. Each position I have held has helped me grow in one of three important ways: technically, by challenging me with interesting business problems to solve, emotionally, by becoming more confident in myself, and socially, by sharing my gained experiences and knowledge with others in the dev community in Las Vegas.
        </br></br>
        I am currently a Software Engineer for a FinTech company called DebtTrader. We are the nation's leading debt marketplace and focus on trading debt responsibly and consumer financial safety. My daily duties involve everything from setting up new pipelines for continuous integration and continuous deployment of our platform, outlining user flows and process flows, creating new components, squashing bugs, or re-designing an older part of our platform. I am truly a full-stack engineer in every sense! I hope to inspire other women to see that femininity and technical excellence can co-exist. :)"

I am passionate about user driven products, and love being in environments where I am surrounded by people who are just as passionate as I am in building a product that will positively impact its users. Driven by this passion, I have had the opportunity to explore a variety of roles, from Software Engineering at Salesforce and Microsoft, to Technical Program Management at Hulu. Through these experiences, I have learned how to drive a program from a technical standpoint, while also keeping business requirements and original scope in check. On a deeper level, I have gained hands on programming experience at an industry level with front end technologies, cross platform mobile frameworks, the lifecycle of software deployment, and more. I have learned more from these experiences than I ever thought possible, and am so grateful for these opportunities. Now, I am looking forward to my next adventure, where I can dive even deeper in learning about my passion. tl;dr: I have experience in program management, UI design/development, web apps, client facing, and full stack development.”
