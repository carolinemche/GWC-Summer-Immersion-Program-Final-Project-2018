    <about>“Hi! I'm a junior at Cornell studying electrical and computer engineering. I was a GWC SIP participant in 2014, and since then I've interned at Oath/AOL, IAC, Girls Who Code, and, most recently, Qualcomm. I've co-founded three hackathon organizations: def hacks(), for high schoolers by high schoolers; FwdCode, a college hackathon for social good; and ProgramHers, a hackathon organization to immerse females in tech. At school, I am the founder and president of our chapter of the Alpha Omega Epsilon engineering sorority and a Vice President for Women in Computing at Cornell. Additionally, I am a fellow of Rewriting the Code, a member of the #BUILTBYGIRLS community, and a tech/lifestyle blogger. When I have free time, I love reading, watching new Marvel movies, and trying new foods.”</about>
